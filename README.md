Just another nCurses game...

A fun game to play, game starts by looking for a file named map1.cg in the resources folder, and... the user can take over from there, by defining portals to other maps which is loaded in runtime.

The code is messy, and begs for a clean-up. There is a lot of code that can be removed without affecting the current state of the game. It should at least be linked-off from compilation.
